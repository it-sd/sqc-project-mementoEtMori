      This website is dedicated to the access and exposure of charitable organizations globally. 
      You will be able to search for charities by name and follow the given links to those 
      charities' websites for further information and donation possibilities. This "Search Results" 
      table will populate with the charities most associated with the user's search terms. 
      There will be a second page that will have a table that displays the most recent 
      searches/links clicked so the user can identify what others have been recently viewing/ donating to.
